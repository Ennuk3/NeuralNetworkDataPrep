    <h2>check_surr</h2>
    <p>
    This function finds the first instance of a minimal gradient within the upper end of a Charpy curve.<br>
    This is acheived by calculating the difference between the chosen point (index) and the average of the 1000 points before and after the chosen point.<br>
    If the point is not within a range of 1 between both points, then the next point is selected by increasing the index by 1.<br><br>
    
    Parameters<br>
    ----------<br>
    <b>array</b> : tuple<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        input Charpy data, based on which the initial curve is plotted<br>
    <b>index</b> : int<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        the index value at which the gradient minimizing function is chosen to begin based on parameters in previous code<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        (must be further than the transition point, otherwise the function does not work properly)<br><br>
        
    Returns<br>
    -------<br>
    <b>index</b> : int<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        returns the index at which the gradient of the function is deemed to first reach a defined minimum
